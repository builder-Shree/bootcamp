        <div><h1>This is a block level element inside another block level element.</h1>
        <p>This is another block level element which is paragraph tag.</p></div>
        <div>
            <p>The difference between block and inline element is <span>Block element</span> takes the whole 
            width and starts from new line whereas <span>inline element</span> takes only the required space and 
        doesn't starts from new line .Here I had used span tag which is a inline element.</p>
